# **ACTIVE SHOOTER: HOW TO RESPOND**  

## **Profile of an Active Shooter**
An **Active Shooter** is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area. In most cases:
- Firearms are used.
- There is no pattern or method to victim selection.
- Situations evolve quickly and are unpredictable.
- Law enforcement is usually required to stop the threat.
- Most incidents end within 10–15 minutes—before police arrive.

### **Best Practices**
- Stay aware of surroundings and possible dangers.
- Identify two nearest exits in any facility.
- If in an office, stay and secure the door.
- If in a hallway, find a room and secure it.
- As a **last resort**, if unable to flee, attempt to incapacitate the shooter.

# **ACTIVE SHOOTER: HOW TO RESPOND**

RUN: Evacuate If Possible
If there is considerable distance between you and the gunfire/armed person, quickly move away from the sound of the gunfire/armed person. If the gunfire/armed person is in your building and it is safe to do so, run out of the building and move far away until you are in a secure place to hide.
Leave your belongings behind.
Keep your hands visible to law enforcement.
Take others with you, but do not stay behind because others will not go.
Call 911 when it is safe to do so. Do not assume that someone else has reported the incident. The information that you are able to provide law enforcement may be critical, e.g. number of shooters, physical description and identification, number and type(s) of weapons, and location of the shooter.
