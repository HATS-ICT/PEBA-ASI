# PEBA-PEvo: Implicit Behavioral Alignment of Language Agents

This repository contains the implementation of Persona–Environment Behavioral Alignment (PEBA) and its optimization algorithm, PersonaEvolve (PEvo) in a Unity3D-based Active Shooter Incident Simulation. The framework reduces the Behavior–Realism Gap by iteratively refining agent personas so their collective behaviors match expert expectations.

Codebase clean-up is work in progress and will be added in two weeks.
