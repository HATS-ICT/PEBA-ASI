This repository accompanies our research paper titled [Implicit Behavioral Alignment of Language Agents in High-Stakes Crowd Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16457), and contains the implementation of Persona–Environment Behavioral Alignment (PEBA) and its optimization algorithm, PersonaEvolve (PEvo) in a Unity3D-based Active Shooter Incident Simulation. The framework reduces the Behavior–Realism Gap by iteratively refining agent personas so their collective behaviors match expert expectations. For more information, visit our [project homepage](https://hats-ict.github.io/peba-asi-web/).

> [!NOTE]  
> **Proprietary Constraints Notice** The original Unity environment scene will not be made publicly available at the moment due to proprietary constraints. We provide sample simulation log data and a interactive replay web viewer for visualization and data analysis code for educational purposes.
